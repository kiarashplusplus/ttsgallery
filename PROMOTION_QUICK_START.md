## 📝 Pre-Written Templates

### Reddit Post (r/programming)
```markdown
Title: I built an open-source Azure OpenAI TTS voice sampler (all 23 voices)

I created TTS Gallery, an open-source tool for testing Azure OpenAI TTS voices.

**The problem**: When integrating TTS into an app, it's hard to test all 23 
available voices without writing code.

**The solution**: A single-page app where you can test any voice with custom 
text and compare them side-by-side.

**Tech Stack**: React 19, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, Vite
**Privacy**: 100% client-side, zero data collection

Excited to share my latest project: TTS Gallery 🎙️

After working with Azure OpenAI's TTS API, I realized there wasn't an easy

So I built a free, open-source tool: https://tts.gallery

Key features:
✅ All 23 voices in one interface
✅ Privacy-first: runs in your browser
✅ No backend required
✅ Free & open-source

Perfect for developers integrating TTS into their applications.

#### 🔶 Reddit Communities

##### r/programming
**Best approach**: Focus on open-source and technical implementation

**Post Title**: "I built an open-source Azure OpenAI TTS voice sampler (all 23 voices)"

**Post Template**:
```
I created TTS Gallery, an open-source tool for testing Azure OpenAI TTS voices.

**The problem**: When integrating TTS into an app, it's hard to test all 23 available 
voices without writing code or switching between documentation pages.

**The solution**: A single-page app where you can:
- Test any voice with custom text
- Play through all voices sequentially
- Compare voice characteristics side-by-side

**Tech Stack**:
- React 19 + TypeScript
- Tailwind CSS + Shadcn UI
- 100% client-side (no backend needed)
- Vite for blazing fast builds

**Privacy & Security**:
- All credentials stored locally (encrypted)
- Zero data collection or analytics
- API calls made directly from browser to Azure
- Open source - verify the code yourself

🔗 Live demo: https://tts.gallery
🔗 GitHub: https://github.com/kiarashplusplus/ttsgallery

MIT licensed. PRs welcome!

Would love to hear your thoughts or suggestions for improvements.
```

**Guidelines**:
- Be genuine and helpful in comments
- Don't be overly promotional
- Share technical insights if asked
- Follow subreddit self-promotion rules

##### r/azure
**Focus**: Azure developer utility

**Post Title**: "Free tool to preview all 23 Azure OpenAI TTS voices"

**Post Template**:
```
Hey Azure devs! 👋

I built a free tool to preview all Azure OpenAI TTS voices in one place: https://tts.gallery

**Why I built this**:
Working with Azure OpenAI TTS, I found it tedious to test different voices. You have to:
1. Write code or use Postman
2. Reference documentation for voice names
3. Test each voice separately

**What it does**:
- Preview all 23 voices (Standard, Neural, HD)
- Use your own Azure OpenAI credentials
- Test with custom text
- Play through all voices automatically
- 100% browser-based, no server needed

**Features**:
✅ All voices: Alloy, Echo, Nova, Ash, Ballad, Cedar, and 17 more
✅ Credentials stored securely in your browser
✅ No data collection or tracking
✅ Open-source (MIT)
✅ Mobile responsive

Perfect for:
- Choosing voices before implementation
- Client demos
- Quality testing with your content

GitHub: https://github.com/kiarashplusplus/ttsgallery

Hope this helps other Azure devs! Feedback welcome.
